    <img  src="./Assest/Images/solar-system-vector-illustrations-planets-600nw-590583566.webp" alt="Explore the Solar System through a fun image where each planet has a friendly face! In the center, the Sun shines bright. Moving outwards, meet Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, each with its own happy expression. A playful alien in a UFO adds a touch of space magic. Two rockets soar high, and two rocks drift gently in the cosmic dance. Join the adventure as Prashant discovers the wonders of our solar neighborhood!">
    <p class="mainpara mainparas">Hey there, little space explorers! Did you know that the Sun is like a big, shiny light bulb in the sky? <br> It's super bright and keeps all the planets, like Earth, cozy and warm. <br> The Sun is like the boss of our space neighborhood, making sure everyone stays happy! </p>

As Alex flew past each planet, they noticed how different each one was, like a family of cosmic characters. Alex realized that the Sun was like their superhero, and without it, our space family wouldn't be as amazing.</p>
